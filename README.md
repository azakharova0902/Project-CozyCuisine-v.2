This website was designed to share simple and delicious recipes for any occasion that are developed by experienced Chef of Cozy Cuisine Ltd. It gives you access to a wide range of mouthwatering options for you and your family! In addition, Cozy Cuisine offers culinary workshops to help you believe that YOU. CAN. COOK.

# UX

Cozy Cuisine website targets not only exquisite gourmets, but rather anyone who is passionate about tastes and savors. Its mission is to ensure that a broader public gets exposed to amazing world of diverse flavors. Our eye-catching design helps us stand out from our numerous competitors and take a special place in the hearts of those who ever had a chance to visit it. 

The website is very intuitive which makes its navigation smooth and fast. Information is well structured and stored in logical sections. Those useres interested in exploring featured recipes will easily find there way to our Recipes section from the main navigation bar and relevant links on the Home webpage. The same concept applies to finding information about upcoming workshops and sing up form.

# Technologies

2. CSS
3. Bootstrap
4. Java Script
5. jQuery
6. Spoonacular API (RESTful API)
7. Google Maps API

# Features

Our website provides its users with various functionalities. 
1. Google Maps API : One of our main feautures is implementation of Goodle maps API. Upon page load, a map appears on Workshop.html (centered on GTA). We have used a Geocoder in order to automatically define user's location upon their consent. Google Directions API allows our users to find driving directions to any address they enter.
2. Spoonacular API : To build a website that stands out from its competitors, we have partnered with Spoonacular to get access to their enormous recipes database. Our Search.html page has a search bar that takes user's input and returns one of the recipes that matches the query (ingredients/dishes).

# Features to be implemented later

Over the time, we are planning to build up on this project. We will be looking into enhancing its search options to enable filtering by cuisine / nutrition value / max calories etc. Also, we want to display multiple recipes at once and implements widges to create a recipe card for each.

# Test

Our users goals were successfully achieved due to the proper Information Structure and intuitive design. As a visitor, you can smoothly surf our website through an interactive navbar that conveniently highlights the options as you hover over them. Underlined links in "Our Story" section of the Home page will forward the user to a proper section of the website without having to scroll up to the bavbar. All users can easily jump to our social media webpages by clicking the links hiden in Font Awesome icons in the footer.

Our "Workshop" section provides the spotlights of the upcoming even featuring its duration, price, location and date on the top of the main details box. In addition to that, our users can find driving directions on a map. Furthermore, the 'required' attributes have beed added to all the fields, so if they are not filled in, thea user will not be able to get directions.

All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"' and have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination. Moreover, a hover effect has been added for a better user experience.

Th website has been tested accros multiple browsers and deviced to ensure its responsiveness and compatibility.
