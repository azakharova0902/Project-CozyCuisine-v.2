Cozy Cuisine website targets not only exquisite gourmets, but rather anyone who is passionate about tastes and savors. Its mission is to ensure that a broader public gets exposed to amazing world of diverse flavors. Our eye-catching design helps us stand out from our numerous competitors and take a special place in the hearts of those who ever had a chance to visit it. 

The website is very intuitive which makes its navigation smooth and fast. Information is well structured and stored in logical sections. Those useres interested in exploring featured recipes will easily find there way to our Recipes section from the main navigation bar and relevant links on the Home webpage. The same concept applies to finding information about upcoming workshops and sing up form.

# Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap

# Features

Our website includes an embeded Google Maps with a marked location of our workshops. This feature adds convenience to our users and eliminates the necessity to jump onto a different webpage to look up the exact location.

# Features Left to Implement

Over the time, I am looking to build up on this project and link a database to serve "Our recipes" section of the website.

# Test

Our users goals were successfully achieved due to the proper Information Structure and intuitive design. As a visitor, you can smoothly surf our website through an interactive navbar that conveniently highlights the options as you hover over them. Underlined links in "Our Story" section of the Home page will forward the user to a proper section of the website without having to scroll up to the bavbar. "Our Recipes" section is structured in a way that different meal types are combined respectively (ex. breakfast recipes/ main course/ deserts). All users can easily jump to our social media webpages by clicking the links hiden in Font Awesome icons in the footer.

Our "Workshop" section provides the spotlights of the upcoming even featuring its duration, price, location and date on the top of the main details box.

All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"' and have been manually tested to ensure that they are pointing to the correct destination. Moreover, a hover effect has been added for a better user experience.

If our user inputs an invalid email address upon submission of the Sign Up form, there will be an error asking to enter a valid email address. Furthermore, the 'required' attributes have beed added to all the fields, so if they are not filled in, thea user will not be able to submit the form. 

Th website has been tested accros multiple browsers and deviced to ensure its responsiveness and compatibility.
